# Underwater Image Enhancement Project

## Main Task

In this task, you will learn and implement various techniques related to image generation. You will be using these techniques to enhance the quality of underwater images ([Link to dataset](https://kaggle.com/datasets/b498391bea2bc8b0c6301bf2cd8820ef3bca6896e07ce2a50b54a62859db050e)). 

Your code for each subtask should be present in a file called ``subtask<number>.ipynb``. The VAEs task, for example will be present in a notebook called ``subtask1.ipynb``. All your notebooks should be in the ``Task 2`` folder. Write clean code and make sure to add proper comments.

## Subtasks

### Subtask 1: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Implement and train a VAE for underwater image enhancement.
- Generate enhanced images using the trained VAE.

### Subtask 2: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - MNIST Practice
- Learn about GANs.
- Implement a basic GAN for the MNIST dataset.
- Train and evaluate the GAN on MNIST.

### Subtask 3: GANs for Underwater Image Enhancement
- Implement a GAN using the generator and discriminator described in the paper linked below.
- Train the GAN on underwater images.
- Generate enhanced images using the trained GAN.

### Subtask 4: Diffusion Models
- Implement a diffusion model for image enhancement
- Use boiler plate code provided for starting
- Train the diffusion model on underwater images
- Generate enhanced images using the trained diffusion model

## Conclusion
- Compare results from all three methods (VAE, GAN, Diffusion) based on PSNR, MSE and SSIM scores.
- Determine which method performs best for underwater image enhancement
